            <h3>ABOUT THE FPD</h3>
            <p class="about">Futureville Police Department celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2011. For over a century-and-a-quarter the FPD has been keeping residents of Futureville safe with a combination of innovative crime prevention techniques and old-fashioned police work.

                The men and women of the FPD believe in a level of service that routinely goes "Beyond the Call." They embrace standards of performance that include Integrity, Compassion, Accountability, Respect, and Excellence (ICARE).
